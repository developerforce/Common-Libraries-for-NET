In an effort to streamline support for the Force.com Toolkits for .NET (including the Common Libraries for .NET) we have consolidated all the repositories to the [Force.com Toolkit for .NET](https://github.com/developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET).

You can still get the Common Libraries for .NET by installing the NuGet:

```
Install-Package DeveloperForce.Common
```
